## These functions take the inverse of a matrix and cache
## the solution for future use if the same matrix is used

## This function caches the inverse of a matrix object

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function solves the inverse of the matrix from makeCacheMatrix
## unless the matrix is unchanged, in which case the solution is
## retrieved from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
